1-7. Really and truly, instruciton encodings are things
   you'll need to either memorize or keep a reference 
   handy for. There's a good reference in the slides (I 
   believe W9 U2) that lists the byte encoding for each
   Y86 instruciton, as well as the valid ifun, register
   operands, and valC.

5. There's a REG_NONE register nybble in a rmmovq instruction,
   which requires both ra and rb.

6. There are only 4 ALU operations available in Y86, so the
   only valid ifun nybbles are 0-3.

7. This instruction is valid. It would be 
   irmovq $0x0807060504030201, %rdx.
